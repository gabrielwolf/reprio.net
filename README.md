## A simple priority queue for organising your tasks. 

- To add a task simply type it into the field, move to the priority field, and type a priority from 1-10, then and press return. Done.  
- Change a task at any time by clicking on the cell and making your changes. It gets saved as you leave the cell. 
- Your data is stored in your browser via localStorage. (Delete your browser’s cache and it’s gone.)
- You can easily back up your data via the import and export buttons in JSON format.

That’s it. Happy prioritising! :)
