## A simple priority queue for organising your tasks. 

- Add a task: 1. Type it 2. Type the priority 3. Press return (or leave the cell by pressing tab).
- Change a task: 1. Select it 2. Change it. 3. Leave the cell.
- Security: Your data is stored in the browser (via localStorage).  
  Press reset, or delete your browser’s cache and you’re safe.  
  But remember, everyone with physical access to your browser window can read as long as data is stored... no magic here.
- Backup: Press the import and export buttons. (Downloads a file in JSON format.)

That’s it. Happy prioritising! :)
