## A simple priority queue for organising your tasks. 

- Add a task: 1. Type it 2. Type the priority 3. Press return.
- Change a task: 1. Select it 2. Change it. 3. Leave the cell.
- Security: Your data is stored in the browser (via localStorage).  
  Press reset, or delete your browser’s cache and you’re safe.  
  But remember, everyone with access to your computer and browser can read... no magic here.
- Backup: Press the import and export buttons. (Downloads a file in JSON format.)

That’s it. Happy prioritising! :)
